# Linked list

In this exersize you'll need to reverse a single linked list

For example:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null

Will reverse to:
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null

## Usage

Print list using the following command:

```bash
php assessment-challenges/linked-list/reverseLinkedList.php
```

## Tests

Run unit tests without code coverage using the following command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage
```

If you want code coverage, enable xdebug first and then run the unit tests:

```bash
enable_xdebug
./vendor/bin/phpunit
disable_xdebug
```
